## Overview

AI coding assistants embed LLM capabilities directly into the IDE, providing inline completions, chat-based Q&A about code, and whole-function generation. They are now a proven productivity multiplier for most development tasks.

## Key Tools

| Tool | Vendor | Strength |
|------|--------|----------|
| GitHub Copilot | GitHub / Microsoft | Broadest IDE support, team management |
| Cursor | Cursor Inc. | Deep codebase context, multi-file edits |
| Windsurf | Codeium | Fast, free tier, agentic flows |
| JetBrains AI | JetBrains | Native integration with JetBrains IDEs |

## When to Use

- Accelerating routine code (boilerplate, CRUD, tests)
- Understanding unfamiliar legacy code quickly
- Generating first drafts of documentation or migration scripts

## Risks & Considerations

- **Hallucinations**: Generated code must be reviewed — LLMs confidently produce plausible-looking but wrong code
- **Over-reliance**: Junior developers may skip learning fundamentals
- **IP / data privacy**: Check whether code is sent to third-party servers; use self-hosted models for sensitive IP
