description: "Auto-generating API docs, changelogs, architecture summaries, and README files from code and commit history."

## Overview

LLMs can generate and maintain documentation that developers routinely skip writing. From API reference docs to architecture decision records, AI tools can draft first versions that humans then review and refine.

## Use Cases

- **API docs** from OpenAPI specs or annotated code
- **Changelogs** generated from conventional commits
- **README files** from project structure and code analysis
- **Architecture summaries** from code exploration
- **Runbooks** drafted from existing scripts and configs

## When to Use

- Documentation is consistently out of date or missing
- Onboarding new team members to legacy systems
- Generating initial docs before open-sourcing a project

## Risks & Considerations

- Generated docs inherit misunderstandings from the code; always review
- Docs that are never maintained become misleading — treat as a starting point
- Sensitive internal details may end up in docs accidentally
