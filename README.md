# Agentic Software Modernization Roadmap (ASMR)

Agentic Software Modernization Roadmap is a technology roadmap focused on the tools, patterns, and practices required to modernize legacy software systems using agentic AI.

_Draft version 2026-02-23_

## Project Overview

Modernizing legacy systems is notoriously difficult and high-risk. Agentic AI—autonomous agents that can plan, reason, and execute across a codebase—offers a new paradigm for accelerating this process. This roadmap categorizes and tracks the maturity of these emerging technologies and classic software engineering practices that provide the necessary "harness" for AI to operate safely.

## Project Status

This roadmap is an early draft and a proof of concept generated by Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Gemini 3 Pro with prompts from Markus Harrer. 


## Key Categories

The roadmap is organized into four primary areas:

*   **Agentic AI Tools:** Multi-step autonomous agents (Claude Code, Devin) and the styles of programming they enable (Vibe Coding, Harness Engineering).
*   **AI Tooling Setup:** The infrastructure required to support AI workflows (Model Context Protocol, Vector Databases, LLM Observability).
*   **Legacy Modernization:** Proven patterns for decoupling and understanding old systems (Strangler Fig, Anti-Corruption Layer, AI-assisted Legacy Code Reading).
*   **Architecture & Delivery:** The foundational engineering disciplines that make AI-generated code safe for production (CI/CD Pipelines, Feature Flags, Agent Sandboxing).

## Maturity Stages

Practices and technologies are tracked through six stages:
- **Hold On:** Not yet suitable. Watch and wait.
- **Assess:** Worth investigating to understand impact.
- **Trial:** Try it out in low-risk projects.
- **Apply:** Ready to use; proven choice for appropriate contexts.
- **Stop:** Do not adopt for new work.
- **Remove:** Phase out completely.

## Contributing

Contributions in the form of new practices, refined descriptions, or maturity adjustments are welcome. Currently, the focus is on scoping the right practices and revising the texts for those.

## About the Name

If this roadmap gives you a tingly sensation in your brain, don't worry—it's just the **ASMR** (Agentic Software Modernization Roadmap) doing its job. Warning: Watching your technical debt disappear may cause extreme relaxation.

## About the name

It's totally coincidence that there is also ASMR.
