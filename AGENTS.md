## Stage placement

Every time you add or change the stage of a practice, add a short summary of that decision in the **Staging History** section, or ask the user for a rationale if none was provided.

## Practice description

Use `PRACTICE_TEMPLATE.md` as the structure for every practice body. Every practice must fit the theme of this roadmap: modernizing legacy software systems using AI coding tools and AI agents.

## Practice linking

Search for related practices and link to them directly in the **Related Patterns** section.

## Git usage

Do not commit or push changes unless explicitly instructed by the user.
